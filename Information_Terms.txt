Fundamental Frequency (Fo): Normal values tend to range between 85 Hz to 255 Hz for males and females. Parkinson's patients typically have a much lower or irregular Fo due to vocal tremors.

Max and Min Fundamental Frequencies (Fhi and Flo): These values for non-Parkinson individuals usually follow the natural range of human vocal frequencies (from 85 Hz to 300 Hz).

RAP (Relative Average Perturbation):
Normal: Typically below 0.01 for healthy individuals.

PPQ (Period Perturbation Quotient):
Normal: Generally below 0.01 for healthy individuals.

DDP (Difference of Difference of Periods):
Normal: Usually below 0.05.

Jitter (Percentage and Absolute): Jitter represents the frequency variation in voice signals. Non-Parkinson individuals tend to have lower jitter values, generally close to 0%, while Parkinson’s patients often have higher jitter values due to vocal instability.

Shimmer: Shimmer measures amplitude variation in the voice. For non-Parkinson individuals, shimmer values tend to be low, typically around 0.1 to 0.5 dB. Higher shimmer values may indicate vocal instability, which is common in Parkinson's patients.

NHR (Noise to Harmonics Ratio): NHR indicates the amount of noise in a voice signal. Non-Parkinson individuals generally have lower NHR values. For non-Parkinson’s individuals, values are typically around 0.1 or lower. Higher values may indicate vocal issues due to Parkinson's disease.

HNR (Harmonics to Noise Ratio): HNR is the inverse of NHR and is higher in non-Parkinson individuals. Normal HNR values should be around 20 dB or higher. Lower values indicate a noisier vocal signal, which is common in Parkinson’s patients.

RPDE, DFA, PPE: These are nonlinear dynamic measures and tend to be higher in Parkinson's patients. There aren’t clear-cut “normal” values for these features, but lower values generally indicate a healthier vocal signal.
